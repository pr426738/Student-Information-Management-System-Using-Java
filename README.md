Student Management System (Java)

A clean and modular Java console application designed to manage student information efficiently. This project demonstrates strong understanding of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), collections, and user-interactive CLI development.

Project Summary

The Student Management System allows users to perform essential student data operations such as adding, viewing, and searching student records. It uses Java’s ArrayList to store objects dynamically and a menu-driven structure to ensure smooth navigation. This project is ideal for academic submission, learning purposes, or as a foundational management tool.

Key Features

Add Student (Roll No, Name, Course)
View All Students
Search Student by Roll Number
Stores data dynamically using ArrayList<Student>
Interactive menu-driven CLI
Simple, modular, and easily extendable codebase

Tech Stack

Prerequisites

Java JDK 8 or above installed
Basic understanding of Java CLI programs

Run the Application
# Compile
javac StudentManagementSystem.java

# Run
java StudentManagementSystem


How the Program Works

1)The program displays a menu with available operations.
2)Students are stored as objects of the Student class.
3)User actions are handled with a loop and switch-case structure.
4)Roll numbers are used as unique identifiers during search.
5)The system runs until the user selects “Exit”.


Future Improvements

Update and Delete student records
File handling for persistent data storage
Integrated database support (MySQL / SQLite)
Graphical User Interface using Swing or JavaFX
REST API or Web-based version
